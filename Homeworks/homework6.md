<h2>Question 1: Redpanda version</h2>
Now let's find out the version of redpandas.<br>

For that, check the output of the command rpk help inside the container. The name of the container is redpanda-1.<br>

Find out what you need to execute based on the help output.<br>

What's the version, based on the output of the command you executed? (copy the entire version)<br><br>
**answer: rpk version v24.2.18**

<h2>Question 2. Creating a topic</h2>
Before we can send data to the redpanda server, we need to create a topic. We do it also with the rpk command we used previously for figuring out the version of redpandas.<br><br>

Read the output of help and based on it, create a topic with name green-trips<br>

What's the output of the command for creating a topic? Include the entire output in your answer.<br><br>
**answer:** <br>
TOPIC        STATUS <br>
green-trips  OK
